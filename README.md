**Official Central Bank of Türkiye (Türkiye) daily exchange rates for Node.js and TypeScript. The published central bank rates behind tax filings, customs valuations, audits, and compliant invoicing — not market estimates, but the numbers Central Bank of Türkiye itself prints, every business day.**

## 🚀 Why this client?

- 🏛️ **Official published rates** — Central Bank of Türkiye's own table, with the publisher's own `rate_date` on every response
- 📅 **History back to 2020** — point-in-time tables and daily series for any past date
- 🔀 **Published vs derived, always flagged** — computed inverse/cross pairs carry `derived: true`, never mixed with official prints
- ⚡ **Zero dependencies** — pure ESM + CJS over global `fetch`; Node 18+, Bun, Deno, and edge runtimes
- 🔷 **Type-safe** — full TypeScript definitions shipped with the package
- 🧾 **Compliance-grade metadata** — `rate_type`, publication date, and source disclaimer on every response

### Latest pair rate

Free plan and up. Pairs the central bank does not print directly are resolved from its table and flagged (see *Published vs derived rates* below).

```js
const pair = await getRate('USD', 'TRY', { apiKey: 'art_live_...' });
```

**Response:**

```javascript
{
  bank: 'tcmb',
  name: 'Central Bank of Türkiye',
  rate_date: '2026-08-11',   // Central Bank of Türkiye's own publication date
  source: 'USD',
  target: 'TRY',
  rate: 47.7364,
  rate_type: 'sell',
  derived: false,
  method: 'published',
  disclaimer: '…'
}
```

### Full published table

Free plan and up. The complete table for the latest publication date.

```js
import { getLatestRates } from 'tcmb-exchange-rate';

const table = await getLatestRates({ apiKey: 'art_live_...' });
console.log(table.rate_date, table.rates.length);
```

**Response:**

```javascript
{
  bank: 'tcmb',
  name: 'Central Bank of Türkiye',
  rate_date: '2026-08-11',
  rates: [
    { "base": "USD", "quote": "TRY", "type": "sell", "value": 47.7364 },
    { "base": "USD", "quote": "TRY", "type": "buy", "value": 47.6505 },
    // … the rest of the published table (22 currencies vs TRY)
  ],
  disclaimer: '…'
}
```

### Table for a date

Paid plans. The official table for any date since 2020 — weekends and holidays return the most recent published date, flagged via `published_on_requested_date`, which is exactly the in-force rate a filing needs.

```js
import { getRatesForDate } from 'tcmb-exchange-rate';

const day = await getRatesForDate('2026-06-30', { apiKey: 'art_live_...' });
// Optionally narrow to one pair:
const one = await getRatesForDate('2026-06-30', { apiKey: 'art_live_...', source: 'USD', target: 'TRY' });
```

**Response:**

```javascript
{
  bank: 'tcmb',
  requested_date: '2026-06-30',
  rate_date: '2026-06-30',                // the date actually published
  published_on_requested_date: true,      // false when a weekend/holiday fell back
  rates: [ /* the full table for that date */ ],
  disclaimer: '…'
}
```

### Daily time series

Paid plans. One resolved rate per publication date — ready for charting, revaluation runs, or audit workpapers.

```js
import { getHistory } from 'tcmb-exchange-rate';

const series = await getHistory(
  { source: 'USD', target: 'TRY', from: '2026-01-01', to: '2026-08-11' },
  { apiKey: 'art_live_...' }
);
```

**Response:**

```javascript
{
  bank: 'tcmb',
  source: 'USD',
  target: 'TRY',
  from: '2026-01-01',
  to: '2026-08-11',
  count: 152,
  rates: [
    // one entry per publication date
    { date: '2026-08-11', rate: 47.7364, rate_type: 'sell', derived: false, method: 'published' },
    // …
  ],
  disclaimer: '…'
}
```

Pass `{ symbol: 'USD' }` instead of `source`/`target` to get the raw published rows for one currency (all rate types, no pair resolution).

## 🗺️ Currencies covered

Central Bank of Türkiye currently publishes rates covering **23 currencies** (as of the latest table):

`AED` · `AUD` · `AZN` · `CAD` · `CHF` · `CNY` · `DKK` · `EUR` · `GBP` · `JPY` · `KRW` · `KWD` · `KZT` · `NOK` · `PKR` · `QAR` · `RON` · `RUB` · `SAR` · `SEK` · `TRY` · `USD` · `XDR`

## ⚖️ Published vs derived rates

If Central Bank of Türkiye does not print a pair directly, the API resolves it from the central bank's own table and says so — official and computed values are never confused:

| `method` | `derived` | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `published` | `false` | The central bank printed this pair directly |
| `inverse` | `true` | Computed as 1 ÷ the published opposite direction |
| `cross` | `true` | Computed via TRY from two published rates |

## 🛡️ Error handling

Errors are thrown as `Error` with `status` (HTTP code) and `body` (the API's JSON error) attached:

```js
try {
  const pair = await getRate('USD', 'XXX', { apiKey: 'art_live_...' });
} catch (err) {
  console.log(err.message); // human-readable reason
  console.log(err.status);  // e.g. 404
}
```

| Status | Meaning |
| ------ | ------- |
| — | Missing `apiKey` (thrown before any request) |
| `400` | Malformed date or parameters |
| `401` | Invalid API key |
| `403` | Endpoint needs a [paid plan](https://allratestoday.com/pricing/) (historical dates & series) |
| `404` | Pair or date range not covered by Central Bank of Türkiye |
| `429` | Monthly quota exceeded |

## 🔷 TypeScript

Full definitions ship with the package — no `@types` install:

```ts
import type { LatestRates, PairRate, DatedRates, RateEntry, HistoryQuery, RequestOptions } from 'tcmb-exchange-rate';
```

## 📦 CommonJS

```javascript
const { getRate } = require('tcmb-exchange-rate');

getRate('USD', 'TRY', { apiKey: 'art_live_...' }).then((pair) => console.log(pair.rate));
```

## 💡 Quota tips

- Rates change once per business day — cache the published table locally and a small monthly quota goes a long way.
- Every request counts toward your AllRatesToday quota, shared across all AllRatesToday endpoints on your key.
